<!-- Homework 14: Logic programming -->

<p>
<b>Reading:</b>
Abelson &amp; Sussman, Section 4.4.1-3
<p>
We are not assigning section 4.4.4, which discusses the implementation of the
query system in detail.  Feel free to read it just for interest; besides
deepening your understanding of logic programming, it provides an example of
using streams in a large project.

<b>Homework:</b>

Abelson &amp; Sussman, exercises 4.56, 4.57, 4.58, 4.65
<p>
For all problems that involve writing queries or rules,
test your solutions. To run the query system and load in the sample data:

<p>
<tt>  <pre>% stk
&#62; (load "&#126;cs61as/lib/query.scm")
&#62; (initialize-data-base microshaft-data-base)
&#62; (query-driver-loop)
</pre></tt>

<p>
You're now in the query system's interpreter.  To add an assertion:

<p>
<tt>  <pre>(assert! (foo bar))
</pre></tt>

<p>
To add a rule:

<p>
<tt>  <pre>(assert! (rule (foo) (bar)))
</pre></tt>

<p>
Anything else is a query.
