<b>Homework:</b> 
<p> 
Note: To use the OOP language you must first
 
<p> 
<tt>  <pre>(load "&#126;cs61as/lib/obj.scm")
</pre></tt> 
 
<p> 
before using <tt>define-class</tt>, etc.
 
<p> 
1.  For a statistical project you need to compute lots of random numbers in
various ranges.  (Recall that <tt>(random&nbsp;10)</tt> returns a random number
between 0 and 9.)  Also, you need to keep track of <i>how many</i> random
numbers are computed in each range.  You decide to use object-oriented
programming.  Objects of the class <tt>random-generator</tt> will accept two
messages.  The message <tt>number</tt> means "give me a random number in your
range" while <tt>count</tt> means "how many <tt>number</tt> requests have you
had?" The class has an instantiation argument that specifies the range of
random numbers for this object, so
 
<p> 
<tt>  <pre>(define r10 (instantiate random-generator 10))
</pre></tt> 
 
<p> 
will create an object such that <tt>(ask&nbsp;r10&nbsp;'number)</tt> will return a random
number between 0 and 9, while <tt>(ask&nbsp;r10&nbsp;'count)</tt> will return the number
of random numbers <tt>r10</tt> has created.
 
<p> 
2.  Define the class <tt>coke-machine</tt>.  The instantiation
arguments for a <tt>coke-machine</tt> are the number of Cokes that can fit
in the machine and the price (in cents) of a Coke:
 
<p> 
<tt>  <pre>(define my-machine (instantiate coke-machine 80 70))
</pre></tt> 
 
<p> 
creates a machine that can hold 80 Cokes and will sell them for 70 cents
each.  The machine is initially empty.  <tt>Coke-machine</tt> objects must
accept the following messages:
 
<p> 
<tt>(ask my-machine 'deposit 25)</tt> means deposit 25 cents.
You can deposit several coins and the machine should remember the total.
 
<p> 
<tt>(ask my-machine 'coke)</tt> means push the button for a Coke.  This either
gives a <tt>Not enough money</tt> or <tt>Machine empty</tt> error message or
returns the amount of change you get.
 
<p> 
<tt>(ask my-machine 'fill 60)</tt> means add 60 Cokes to the machine.
 
<p> 
Here's an example:
 
<p> 
<tt>  <pre>(ask my-machine 'fill 60)
(ask my-machine 'deposit 25)
(ask my-machine 'coke)
NOT ENOUGH MONEY
(ask my-machine 'deposit 25)      ;; Now there's 50 cents in there.
(ask my-machine 'deposit 25)      ;; Now there's 75 cents.
(ask my-machine 'coke)
5                                 ;; return val is 5 cents change.
</pre></tt> 
 
<p> 
You may assume that the machine has an infinite supply of change.
 
<p> 
<br /><br />3.  We are going to use objects to represent decks of cards.  You are given
the list <tt>ordered-deck</tt> containing 52 cards in standard order:
 
<p> 
<tt>  <pre>(define ordered-deck '(AH 2H 3H ... QH KH AS 2S ... QC KC))
</pre></tt> 
 
<p> 
You are also given a function to shuffle the elements of a list:
 
<p> 
<tt>  <pre>(define (shuffle deck)
  (if (null? deck)
      '()
      (let ((card (nth (random (length deck)) deck)))
        (cons card (shuffle (remove card deck))) )))
</pre></tt> 
 
<p> 
A deck object responds to two messages: <tt>deal</tt> and <tt>empty?</tt>.
It responds to <tt>deal</tt> by returning the top card of the deck,
after removing that card from the deck;
if the deck is empty, it responds to <tt>deal</tt> by returning <tt>()</tt>.
It responds to <tt>empty?</tt> by returning <tt>#t</tt> or <tt>#f</tt>,
according to whether all cards have been dealt.
 
<p> 
Write a class definition for <tt>deck</tt>.  When instantiated, a deck
object should contain a shuffled deck of 52 cards.
 
<p> 
4.  We want to promote politeness among our objects.  Write a class
<tt>miss-manners</tt> that takes an object as its instantiation argument.
The new <tt>miss-manners</tt> object should accept only one
message, namely <tt>please</tt>.  The arguments to the <tt>please</tt> 
message should be, first, a message understood by the original
object, and second, an argument to that message.  <b>(Assume
that all messages to the original object require exactly one
additional argument.)</b>  Here is an example using the <tt>person</tt> class
from the upcoming adventure game project:
 
<p> 
<tt>  <pre>&#62; (define BH (instantiate person 'Brian BH-office))
 
&#62; (ask BH 'go 'down)
BRIAN MOVED FROM BH-OFFICE TO SODA
 
&#62; (define fussy-BH (instantiate miss-manners BH))
 
&#62; (ask fussy-BH 'go 'east) 
ERROR: NO METHOD GO
 
&#62; (ask fussy-BH 'please 'go 'east)
BRIAN MOVED FROM SODA TO PSL
</pre></tt>
