<p> 
The technique of multiple inheritance
is described on pages 9 and 10 of "Object-Oriented Programming -
Above-the-line view".
That section discusses the problem of resolving ambiguous patterns
of inheritance, and mentions in particular that it might be better
to choose a method inherited directly from a second-choice parent
over one inherited from a first-choice grandparent.
 
<p> 
Devise an example of such a situation.
Describe the inheritance hierarchy of your example,
listing the methods that each class
provides.  Also describe why it would be more appropriate in this example
for an object to inherit a given method from its second-choice parent
rather than its first-choice grandparent.
