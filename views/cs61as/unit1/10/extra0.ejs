<!-- Extra for experts 10: Client/server paradigm, concurrency -->

<p>
Using the Instant Message program as a starting point, write a mail
server and client.  The mail server should maintain a database of messages
for all users.  (This can just be a list; don't worry about efficient lookup.)
The client should be able to do the following:

<p>
<tt>  <pre>(mail username message)
(get-mail)
</pre></tt>

<p>
<tt>Get-mail</tt> should return a list of messages, which should be deleted
from the server.

<p>
If you want, you can improve this in several ways:  Make deletion from the
server be explicitly requested by the client, invent a subject header (another
argument to <tt>mail</tt>) and have the client show just headers in <tt>
get-mail</tt> and provide another command to read the text of a specific message,
and so on.
