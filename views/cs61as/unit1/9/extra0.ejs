1. Abelson and Sussman, exercises 3.19 and 3.23.

<p>
Exercise 3.19 is incredibly hard
but if you get it, you'll feel great about yourself.  You'll need to
look at some of the other exercises you skipped in this section.

<p>
Exercise 3.23 isn't quite so hard,
but be careful about the O(1)-i.e.&nbsp;<i>constant</i>-time requirement.

<p>
2.  Write the procedure <tt>cxr-name</tt>.  Its argument will be a function
made by composing <tt>car</tt>s and <tt>cdr</tt>s.  It should return the
appropriate name for that function:

<p>
<tt>  <pre>&#62; (cxr-name (lambda (x) (cadr (cddar (cadar x)))))
CADDDAADAR
</pre></tt>
