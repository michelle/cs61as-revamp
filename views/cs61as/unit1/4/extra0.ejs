Write the procedure <tt>cxr-function</tt> that takes as its argument a word
starting with <tt>c</tt>, ending with <tt>r</tt>, and having a string of letters
<tt>a</tt> and/or <tt>d</tt> in between, such as <tt>cdddadaadar</tt>.  It should

Abelson &amp; Sussman, exercise 2.6.  Besides addition, invent multiplication and
exponentiation of nonnegative integers.  If you're <i>really</i>
enthusiastic, see if you can invent subtraction.  (Remember, the rule of this
game is that you have only <tt>lambda</tt> as a starting point.)  Read <tt>
&#126;cs61as/lib/church-hint</tt> for some suggestions.
